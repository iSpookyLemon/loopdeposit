### Summary

This is a project I worked on last summer. It focuses on providing a platform where music producers can share "loops". In the music production industry, loops are short melodic phrases that can be used to create a beat. This website focuses mainly on loops used for rap music and its subgenres. Users can upload their own loops as well as download, like, and comment on loops posted by other users.

### Features

I added a guest feature where users can access the main dashboard without having to log in or create an account. Guests can still download loops but they cannot upload loops.

### Time Spent

I hadn't touched this project since last summer, so it took me around 3-4 hours to implement this new feature.
